## What is Avalon?

Avalon is a 3D video game environment and benchmark designed from scratch for reinforcement learning research. In Avalon, an embodied agent (human or computer) explores a procedurally generated 3D environment, attempting to solve a set of tasks that involve navigating terrain, hunting or gathering food, and avoiding hazards.

Avalon is unique among existing RL benchmarks in that the reward function, world dynamics, and action space are the same for every task, with tasks differentiated solely by altering the environment: its 20 tasks, ranging in complexity from eat and throw to hunt and navigate, each create worlds in which the agent must perform specific skills in order to survive. This setup enables investigations of generalization within tasks, between tasks, and to compositional tasks that require combining skills learned from previous tasks.

Avalon includes a highly efficient game engine, a library of baselines, and a benchmark with scoring metrics evaluated against hundreds of hours of human performance, all of which are open-source and publicly available. We find that standard RL baselines make progress on most tasks but are still far from human performance, suggesting Avalon is challenging enough to advance the quest for generalizable RL.

Check out [our research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13417) for a deeper explanation of why we built Avalon.

## Quickstart

Use Avalon just like you would any other [`gym`](https://github.com/openai/gym) environment.

```python
from avalon.agent.godot.godot_gym import GodotEnvironmentParams
from avalon.agent.godot.godot_gym import TrainingProtocolChoice
from avalon.agent.godot.godot_gym import AvalonEnv
from avalon.datagen.env_helper import display_video

env_params = GodotEnvironmentParams(
    resolution=256,
    training_protocol=TrainingProtocolChoice.SINGLE_TASK_FIGHT,
    initial_difficulty=1,
)
env = AvalonEnv(env_params)
env.reset()

def random_env_step():
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    if done:
        env.reset()
    return obs

observations = [random_env_step() for _ in range(50)]
display_video(observations, fps=10)
```

For a full example on how to create random worlds, take actions as an agent, and display the resulting observations, see [gym_interface_example](./notebooks/gym_interface_example.sync.ipynb).

## Installing

As Avalon is designed as a high-performance RL environment, it's tailored to running in the cloud on headless linux servers with Nvidia GPUs. However, it should also work on macOS.

Avalon relies on [a custom Godot binary](https://github.com/Avalon-Benchmark/godot) optimized for headless rendering and performance. If you intend to inspect, debug or build custom levels, you'll also want the accompanying editor:
```sh
pip install avalon-rl==1.0.0

# needed to actually run environments
python -m avalon.install_godot_binary
```

> Note: the binary will be installed in the package under `avalon/bin/godot` by default to avoid cluttering your system.
> Pure-pip binary packaging is a work-in-progress.

### Ubuntu

On Linux, a Nvidia GPU is required, as the linux builds are set up for headless GPU rendering.

```
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends libegl-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libnvidia-gl libopengl-dev libosmesa6 mesa-utils-extra
pip install avalon-rl
python -m avalon.install_godot_binary
python -m avalon.common.check_install
```

If you're looking to use our RL code, you'll need additionally:
- [pytorch>=1.12.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) with CUDA
- the `avalon-rl[train]` extras package: `pip install avalon-rl[train]`

### Mac

On Mac, a Nvidia GPU is not required, but the environment rendering is not headless - you'll see a godot window pop up for each environment you have open.

```
pip install avalon-rl
python -m avalon.install_godot_binary
python -m avalon.common.check_install
```

### Docker

We also have Docker images set up to run Avalon and train our RL baselines. They require a Nvidia GPU on the host.

#### Training image
```bash
docker build -f ./docker/Dockerfile . --target train --tag=avalon/train

# start the container with an interactive bash terminal
# to enable wandb, add `-e WANDB_API_KEY=<your wandb key>`
docker run -it --gpus 'all,"capabilities=compute,utility,graphics"' avalon/train bash

# in the container, try running
python -m avalon.common.check_install

# or launch eg a PPO training run with
python -m avalon.agent.train_ppo_avalon
```

#### Dev image
You can use the `dev` image to explore the bundled notebooks or to build on top of Avalon
```bash
docker build -f ./docker/Dockerfile . --target dev --tag=avalon/dev

# by default, this starts a jupyter notebook with your local repo copy mapped into the container
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/opt/projects/avalon --gpus 'all,"capabilities=compute,utility,graphics"' avalon/dev 
```
